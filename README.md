# CodeTalks 
Would you like to search a basic social media application? This repository presents an example of a conversaion app allowing group talks and it is an assignment created by Ezran Bayantemur who works for [Kodluyoruz](https://www.kodluyoruz.org/). You can examine [Patika](www.patika.dev) to obtain further information.

This app is implemented by using **react-native**. We use [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) authentication in order to handle sign up and login and benefit from firebase realtime database to deal with created rooms and commnity conversations. Furthuremore, we utilize **Lottie** component to create loading animation.

We performed **react-navigation** in order to manage stack structure.

We implemented **react-redux** so as to handle global variable.

Moreover, we use formik, modal, date-fns, flash-massage etc. to create a successful mobile app.
